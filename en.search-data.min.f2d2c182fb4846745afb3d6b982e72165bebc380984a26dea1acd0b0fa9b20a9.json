He pioneered the study of physiological optics at Dartmouth College, serving as a research professor, then as director of research at the Dartmouth Eye Institute. He conducted important research into aspects of binocular vision, including cyclophoria and aniseikonia. Ames is perhaps best known for constructing illusions of visual perception, most notably the Ames room and the Ames window. He was a leading light in the Transactionalist School of psychology and also made contributions to social psychology.\nAmes is perhaps best known for his eponymous room, window, and chair. These were called \u0026ldquo;equivalent configurations\u0026rdquo; by Ittelson (1952), defined as \u0026ldquo;configurations [in which] identical \u0026lsquo;incoming messages\u0026rsquo; can come from different external physical arrangements. In the absence of other information, equivalent configurations will be perceived as identical, no matter how different they be physically\u0026rdquo;. Ames also developed the concept of \u0026ldquo;transactional ambiguity\u0026rdquo; holding that \u0026ldquo;mental set\u0026rdquo; or expectation could materially affect one\u0026rsquo;s perception of visual and other stimuli, as with the Ames trapezoid. This hypothesis extended the impact of mental set from the widely believed impact on one\u0026rsquo;s conclusions about stimuli (the eyewitness phenomenon) to actual perception of the stimuli itself. If true, it calls seriously into question the value of eyewitness reports even by individuals with no prejudices about their observations. In 1941 Ames began to make notes in the morning on his transactional analysis of perception. In 1960 his collaborator Hadley Cantril published an edited selection from these notes, with a Preface, and included Ames\u0026rsquo; correspondence with John Dewey. In 1954, Ames was awarded an honorary Doctor of Laws by Dartmouth. In 1955 he won the Tillyer Medal, awarded by the Optical Society of America. Ames died on July 3, 1955, and was buried at the Dartmouth Cemetery. His name, and that of his siblings, is also inscribed on the gravestone of his parents at the Hildreth family cemetery in Lowell.\nAmes Window # IRL Ames Room # Ames Room # Commands Key Description b Boxes c Cones t Torus r Reset f Compare EasyCam Controls Camera Conclusions # When three-dimensional scenes are built on two-dimensional canvases (the screen in this case) it is necessary to consider several concepts, among them are the frontal, oblique and aerial perspectives, each one of them with its characteristic vanishing points, in addition to the important line of the horizon. The proper use of the above concepts allows realistically capture a three-dimensional scenario. In the construction of simulated scenarios, it is possible to save resources through perceptive games that trick the viewer into not being able to notice any difference between a complete scenario and another that simply appears to be. The perception of reality is subjective, selective, and temporary so that, if a conflict or knot appears that does not allow an individual to fully understand it, a dialogic process begins with the environment, trying to make a readjustment in his experience. That is why, despite creating images that are not totally faithful, they are totally real, since it is the individual impression that builds the true perception of the world.

So, half of the time there really is no motion cue, and perception goes into default, i.e., no motion. For the dark foot the same holds, only at alternate times.\nWith reduced contrast of the grating, equiluminance of edges and grating is no longer present, so the effect disappears\nThe button “Grid” allows to hide the black bars in order to make the optical effect disappear and thus check the uniform movement of each foot\nPyramid Illusion (Vasarely Illusion) # It was first demonstrated by Martinez-Conde \u0026amp; Macknik at the 2001 Soc Neurosci Meeting.\nThis is a striking perceptual effect related to all phenomena involving lateral inhibition. The effect occurs when concentric squares (or other geometrical figures) of decreasing size and luminance are stacked on top of another.\nIf you consider arrangements of antagonistic centre-surround ganglion cell receptive fields convolving the image. Imagine a cell at a corner with its centre in the lighter patch, it will be inhibited by 1/4 surround from lighter patches and by 3/4 from darker patches. Voilà, the ganglion cells at the edges signal more brightness. However: for perception the ganglion cell information is integrated, and the heavy luminance distortion removed\nIt is why the inverse transformation applied to correct the retinal convolution breaks down in the pyramid\nThe bar located at the top allows you to modify the number of overlapping squares in order to gradually obtain the illusion\n\u0026ldquo;Breathing Square\u0026rdquo; Illusion # This illusion is one of several effects in which a rigid object is shown moving behind small apertures. The object appears to change size or shape as it moves. In this case the apertures become progressively narrower and wider as a square rotates behind them, and the square appears to expand and contract rhythmically that is why is called a breathe.\nIt is possible to make the squares that move from each of the corners disappear by means of the \u0026ldquo;corners\u0026rdquo; button. In this way the so-called \u0026ldquo;breathing\u0026rdquo; disappears, showing what is simply a normal rotation of a square with fixed size\nWhite Xmas Illusion # In this illusion there are only three different colors however apparently each of the trees has a different shade of green.\nThe difference between each of the two trees is only that one of them is under the yellow bars while the other one is under the green bars.\nIn this case it is possible to make the horizontal bars disappear by means of the \u0026ldquo;bars\u0026rdquo; button located at the top. When the bars disappear, it is possible to verify the color parity of the trees.\nFlash-Lag Effect # This illusion is an example of the “flash-lag” effect.\nWhere the two lines nearly meet, the flashing line appears to lag a little behind the other line.\nThe flashing line seem to have a different angle, where they meet there’s a kink.\nOur mental perception and planning mechanisms need to consider the delays in afference, computation \u0026amp; efference. Thus, moving objects are perceived a bit ahead of their assumed trajectory; the flash (because it is stationary) is not. Consequently, one perceives a positional disparity between briefly flashed stationary and moving objects.\nFor this illusion we have a bar with which we can control the speed of the rotation of the line that is always visible When the speed is higher the effect is much clearer\n"},{"id":2,"href":"/showcase/docs/shortcodes/masking/","title":"Masking","section":"Shortcodes","content":" Image Kernels # What is a Convolution? # In image processing, convolution is the process of transforming an image by applying a kernel over each pixel and its local neighbors across the entire image.\nThe Convolution Process involves those two steps.\nIt places the Kernel Matrix over each pixel of the image, multiplies each value of the Kernel with the corresponding pixel it is over. Sums the resulting multiplied values and returns the resulting value as the new value of the center pixel. This process is repeated for each pixel in the image. What is a Kernel? # A kernel is in fact a matrix with an M x N dimension that is smaller than the image matrix. The kernel is also known as the convolution matrix and it\u0026rsquo;s used for the tasks like blurring, sharpening, edge-detection and similar image processing tasks.\nKernels Used in this Example: # The Prewitt Operator: Can be used for both vertical and horizontal edge detection.\nVertical \\( \\begin{bmatrix} 1 \u0026amp; 0 \u0026amp; -1\\\\ 1 \u0026amp; 0 \u0026amp; -1\\\\ 1 \u0026amp; 0 \u0026amp; -1 \\end{bmatrix} \\) Horizontal \\( \\begin{bmatrix} 1 \u0026amp; 1 \u0026amp; 1\\\\ 0 \u0026amp; 0 \u0026amp; 0\\\\ -1 \u0026amp; -1 \u0026amp; -1 \\end{bmatrix} \\) The Sobel Operator: The Sobel operator emphasizes the edges more than the Prewitt operator by replacing 1’s in the central column with 2’s.\nVertical \\( \\begin{bmatrix} 1 \u0026amp; 0 \u0026amp; -1\\\\ 2 \u0026amp; 0 \u0026amp; -2\\\\ 1 \u0026amp; 0 \u0026amp; -1 \\end{bmatrix} \\) Horizontal \\( \\begin{bmatrix} 1 \u0026amp; 2 \u0026amp; 1\\\\ 0 \u0026amp; 0 \u0026amp; 0\\\\ -1 \u0026amp; -2 \u0026amp; -1 \\end{bmatrix} \\) Box: The box kernel is a simple filter that calculates the mean of the pixels in the area covered by the filter.
