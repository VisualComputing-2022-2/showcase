So, half of the time there really is no motion cue, and perception goes into default, i.e., no motion. For the dark foot the same holds, only at alternate times.\nWith reduced contrast of the grating, equiluminance of edges and grating is no longer present, so the effect disappears\nThe button “Grid” allows to hide the black bars in order to make the optical effect disappear and thus check the uniform movement of each foot\nPyramid Illusion (Vasarely Illusion) # It was first demonstrated by Martinez-Conde \u0026amp; Macknik at the 2001 Soc Neurosci Meeting.\nThis is a striking perceptual effect related to all phenomena involving lateral inhibition. The effect occurs when concentric squares (or other geometrical figures) of decreasing size and luminance are stacked on top of another.\nIf you consider arrangements of antagonistic centre-surround ganglion cell receptive fields convolving the image. Imagine a cell at a corner with its centre in the lighter patch, it will be inhibited by 1/4 surround from lighter patches and by 3/4 from darker patches. Voilà, the ganglion cells at the edges signal more brightness. However: for perception the ganglion cell information is integrated, and the heavy luminance distortion removed\nIt is why the inverse transformation applied to correct the retinal convolution breaks down in the pyramid\nThe bar located at the top allows you to modify the number of overlapping squares in order to gradually obtain the illusion\n\u0026ldquo;Breathing Square\u0026rdquo; Illusion # White Xmas Illusion # Flash-Lag Effect # "},{"id":1,"href":"/showcase/docs/shortcodes/masking/","title":"Masking","section":"Shortcodes","content":" Image Kernels # What is a Convolution? # In image processing, convolution is the process of transforming an image by applying a kernel over each pixel and its local neighbors across the entire image.\nThe Convolution Process involves those two steps.\nIt places the Kernel Matrix over each pixel of the image, multiplies each value of the Kernel with the corresponding pixel it is over. Sums the resulting multiplied values and returns the resulting value as the new value of the center pixel. This process is repeated for each pixel in the image. What is a Kernel? # A kernel is in fact a matrix with an M x N dimension that is smaller than the image matrix. The kernel is also known as the convolution matrix and it\u0026rsquo;s used for the tasks like blurring, sharpening, edge-detection and similar image processing tasks.\nKernels Used in this Example: # The Prewitt Operator: Can be used for both vertical and horizontal edge detection.\nVertical \\( \\begin{bmatrix} 1 \u0026amp; 0 \u0026amp; -1\\\\ 1 \u0026amp; 0 \u0026amp; -1\\\\ 1 \u0026amp; 0 \u0026amp; -1 \\end{bmatrix} \\) Horizontal \\( \\begin{bmatrix} 1 \u0026amp; 1 \u0026amp; 1\\\\ 0 \u0026amp; 0 \u0026amp; 0\\\\ -1 \u0026amp; -1 \u0026amp; -1 \\end{bmatrix} \\) The Sobel Operator: The Sobel operator emphasizes the edges more than the Prewitt operator by replacing 1’s in the central column with 2’s.\nVertical \\( \\begin{bmatrix} 1 \u0026amp; 0 \u0026amp; -1\\\\ 2 \u0026amp; 0 \u0026amp; -2\\\\ 1 \u0026amp; 0 \u0026amp; -1 \\end{bmatrix} \\) Horizontal \\( \\begin{bmatrix} 1 \u0026amp; 2 \u0026amp; 1\\\\ 0 \u0026amp; 0 \u0026amp; 0\\\\ -1 \u0026amp; -2 \u0026amp; -1 \\end{bmatrix} \\) Box: The box kernel is a simple filter that calculates the mean of the pixels in the area covered by the filter. This also has a smoothing effect.\n\\( \\frac{1}{9} \\begin{bmatrix} 1 \u0026amp; 1 \u0026amp; 1\\\\ 1 \u0026amp; 1 \u0026amp; 1\\\\ 1 \u0026amp; 1 \u0026amp; 1 \\end{bmatrix} \\) Gaussian: The Gaussian kernel is a filter that calculates the weighted mean of the pixels in the area covered by the filter, it\u0026rsquo;s used to blur an image.\n\\( \\frac{1}{16} \\begin{bmatrix} 1 \u0026amp; 2 \u0026amp; 1\\\\ 2 \u0026amp; 4 \u0026amp; 2\\\\ 1 \u0026amp; 2 \u0026amp; 1 \\end{bmatrix} \\) Sharpen: The sharpen kernel is a filter thah emphasizes differences in adjacent pixel values.

This is also true for changes in the brightness.\nThe histogram shows the frequency of the colors in the image. Note that as the image gets darker, we get more colors at the left of the diagram, and as the image gets brighter, we get more colors at the right.\n"}]
