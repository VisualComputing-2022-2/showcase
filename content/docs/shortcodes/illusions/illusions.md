## "Stepping Feet" Motion Illusion

It was demonstrated by Stuart Anstis in 2003. 

The edges of the light ‘foot’ merge with the light bars and are only visible when they traverse the dark bars. So, half of the time there really is no motion cue, and perception goes into default, i.e., no motion. For the dark foot the same holds, only at alternate times.

With reduced contrast of the grating, equiluminance of edges and grating is no longer present, so the effect disappears

The button “Grid” allows to hide the black bars in order to make the optical effect disappear and thus check the uniform movement of each foot

## Pyramid Illusion (Vasarely Illusion)

It was first demonstrated by [Martinez-Conde](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Susana_Martinez-Conde) & [Macknik](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stephen_Macknik) at the 2001 Soc Neurosci Meeting.

This is a striking perceptual effect related to all phenomena involving lateral inhibition. The effect occurs when concentric squares (or other geometrical figures) of decreasing size and luminance are stacked on top of another.

If you consider arrangements of antagonistic centre-surround ganglion cell receptive fields convolving the image. Imagine a cell at a corner with its centre in the lighter patch, it will be inhibited by 1/4 surround from lighter patches and by 3/4 from darker patches. Voilà, the ganglion cells at the edges signal more brightness. However: for perception the ganglion cell information is integrated, and the heavy luminance distortion removed

It is why the inverse transformation applied to correct the retinal convolution breaks down in the pyramid

The bar located at the top allows you to modify the number of overlapping squares in order to gradually obtain the illusion
