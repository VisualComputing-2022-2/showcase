## "Stepping Feet" Motion Illusion

{{< p5-iframe sketch="/showcase/sketches/illusions/steppingFeetMotionIllusion.js" width="725" height="625" >}}

It was demonstrated by Stuart Anstis in 2003. 

The edges of the light ‘foot’ merge with the light bars and are only visible when they traverse the dark bars. So, half of the time there really is no motion cue, and perception goes into default, i.e., no motion. For the dark foot the same holds, only at alternate times.

With reduced contrast of the grating, equiluminance of edges and grating is no longer present, so the effect disappears

The button “Grid” allows to hide the black bars in order to make the optical effect disappear and thus check the uniform movement of each foot

## Pyramid Illusion (Vasarely Illusion)

{{< p5-iframe sketch="/showcase/sketches/illusions/pyramidIllusion.js" width="725" height="725" >}}

It was first demonstrated by [Martinez-Conde](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Susana_Martinez-Conde) & [Macknik](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stephen_Macknik) at the 2001 Soc Neurosci Meeting.

This is a striking perceptual effect related to all phenomena involving lateral inhibition. The effect occurs when concentric squares (or other geometrical figures) of decreasing size and luminance are stacked on top of another.

If you consider arrangements of antagonistic centre-surround ganglion cell receptive fields convolving the image. Imagine a cell at a corner with its centre in the lighter patch, it will be inhibited by 1/4 surround from lighter patches and by 3/4 from darker patches. Voilà, the ganglion cells at the edges signal more brightness. However: for perception the ganglion cell information is integrated, and the heavy luminance distortion removed

It is why the inverse transformation applied to correct the retinal convolution breaks down in the pyramid

The bar located at the top allows you to modify the number of overlapping squares in order to gradually obtain the illusion

## "Breathing Square" Illusion

{{< p5-iframe sketch="/showcase/sketches/illusions/breathingSquareIllusion.js" width="725" height="725" >}}

This illusion is one of several effects in which a rigid object is shown moving behind small apertures. The object appears to change size or shape as it moves. In this case the apertures become progressively narrower and wider as a square rotates behind them, and the square appears to expand and contract rhythmically that is why is called a breathe.

It is possible to make the squares that move from each of the corners disappear by means of the "corners" button. In this way the so-called "breathing" disappears, showing what is simply a normal rotation of a square with fixed size

## White Xmas Illusion

{{< p5-iframe sketch="/showcase/sketches/illusions/whiteXmas.js" width="425" height="425" >}}

In this illusion there are only three different colors however apparently each of the trees has a different shade of green.

The difference between each of the two trees is only that one of them is under the yellow bars while the other one is under the green bars.

In this case it is possible to make the horizontal bars disappear by means of the "bars" button located at the top. When the bars disappear, it is possible to verify the color parity of the trees.


## Flash-Lag Effect

{{< p5-iframe sketch="/showcase/sketches/illusions/flashLagEffect.js" width="425" height="425" >}}

This illusion is an example of the “flash-lag” effect. 

Where the two lines nearly meet, the flashing line appears to lag a little behind the other line.

The flashing line seem to have a different angle, where they meet there’s a kink.

Our mental perception and planning mechanisms need to consider the delays in afference, computation & efference. Thus, moving objects are perceived a bit ahead of their assumed trajectory; the flash (because it is stationary) is not. Consequently, one perceives a positional disparity between briefly flashed stationary and moving objects.

For this illusion we have a bar with which we can control the speed of the rotation of the line that is always visible When the speed is higher the effect is much clearer
