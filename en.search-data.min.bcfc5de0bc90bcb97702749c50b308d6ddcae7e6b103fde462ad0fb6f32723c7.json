Sums the resulting multiplied values and returns the resulting value as the new value of the center pixel. This process is repeated for each pixel in the image. What is a Kernel? # A kernel is in fact a matrix with an M x N dimension that is smaller than the image matrix. The kernel is also known as the convolution matrix and it\u0026rsquo;s used for the tasks like blurring, sharpening, edge-detection and similar image processing tasks.\nKernels Used in this Example: # The Prewitt Operator: Can be used for both vertical and horizontal edge detection.\nVertical \\( \\begin{bmatrix} 1 \u0026amp; 0 \u0026amp; -1\\\\ 1 \u0026amp; 0 \u0026amp; -1\\\\ 1 \u0026amp; 0 \u0026amp; -1 \\end{bmatrix} \\) Horizontal \\( \\begin{bmatrix} 1 \u0026amp; 1 \u0026amp; 1\\\\ 0 \u0026amp; 0 \u0026amp; 0\\\\ -1 \u0026amp; -1 \u0026amp; -1 \\end{bmatrix} \\) The Sobel Operator: The Sobel operator emphasizes the edges more than the Prewitt operator by replacing 1’s in the central column with 2’s.\nVertical \\( \\begin{bmatrix} 1 \u0026amp; 0 \u0026amp; -1\\\\ 2 \u0026amp; 0 \u0026amp; -2\\\\ 1 \u0026amp; 0 \u0026amp; -1 \\end{bmatrix} \\) Horizontal \\( \\begin{bmatrix} 1 \u0026amp; 2 \u0026amp; 1\\\\ 0 \u0026amp; 0 \u0026amp; 0\\\\ -1 \u0026amp; -2 \u0026amp; -1 \\end{bmatrix} \\) Box: The box kernel is a simple filter that calculates the mean of the pixels in the area covered by the filter. This also has a smoothing effect.\n\\( \\frac{1}{9} \\begin{bmatrix} 1 \u0026amp; 1 \u0026amp; 1\\\\ 1 \u0026amp; 1 \u0026amp; 1\\\\ 1 \u0026amp; 1 \u0026amp; 1 \\end{bmatrix} \\) Gaussian: The Gaussian kernel is a filter that calculates the weighted mean of the pixels in the area covered by the filter, it\u0026rsquo;s used to blur an image.\n\\( \\frac{1}{16} \\begin{bmatrix} 1 \u0026amp; 2 \u0026amp; 1\\\\ 2 \u0026amp; 4 \u0026amp; 2\\\\ 1 \u0026amp; 2 \u0026amp; 1 \\end{bmatrix} \\) Sharpen: The sharpen kernel is a filter thah emphasizes differences in adjacent pixel values.
